The Zenmatrix Service
We agree to provide you with the Zenmatrix Service. The Service includes all of the Zenmatrix products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Zenmatrix’s mission: To connect you with wellness resources and a community dedicated to promoting health, happiness, and personal growth.

Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.
Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Zenmatrix Products. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Zenmatrix.

Your Commitments
In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.

Who can use Zenmatrix: We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Zenmatrix community.

You must be at least 13 years old.

You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.

Permissions You Give to Us
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.

We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.
Additional Rights We Retain
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone’s intellectual property or impersonates another user).
Disputes
We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it’s useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

The laws of the United States will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms (“claim”), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in the United States that has jurisdiction over the claim.
